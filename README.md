# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to have a structured webpage for prework notes. As a new bootcamp student, I built this project as a way to keep all my notes organized so that I could easily navigate through what I've learned. Through this course I have learned the foundation of coding which included HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
